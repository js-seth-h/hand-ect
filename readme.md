# hand-ect

> support `ect` template system through `res.ect` 
> support `helpers` function in view 
> compatible with connec/express


## Examples

 
```coffee  

  ho = require 'handover'
  ect = require '../hand-ect'
  http = require 'http'


  ect.global.upperHelper = (string) ->  # global scope, apply every view
    return string.toUpperCase();

  hand = (req,res,next)->
      data = 
        title : 'Hello, world!',
        id : 'main',
        links: [
          { name : 'Google', url : 'http://google.com/' },
          { name : 'Facebook', url : 'http://facebook.com/' },
          { name : 'Twitter', url : 'http://twitter.com/' }
        ],
        upperHelper : (string) ->  # local scope, apply this view
          return string.toUpperCase();
        
      res.ect 'sample.ect', data

  server = http.createServer ho.make [
    ect 
      ectOption:
        ext: '.ect'
        root : 'test'
    hand
  ]
 
# or with connect/express

  connect = require 'connect'
  app = connect()
  app.use ect()
  app.use hand
```  

## Important! - Shadowing of Datas
  
ect.global < res.data < argument 'data'

```coffee 
#Given
  ect.global.foo = 'a'
  res.foo =  'b'
#result is b
```

```coffee 
#Given
  ect.global.foo = 'a'
  res.foo =  'b'
  res.ect 'sample.ect', { foo : 'c'}
#result is c
```
